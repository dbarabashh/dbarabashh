- ðŸ‘¯ I'm eager to collaborate on initiatives that make a positive impact, while also seeking opportunities to share in the value I help create for others.

## tldr;
- I have extensive experience in developing web interfaces, specifically using the React ecosystem. At this point, I am focusing on growing as a T-shaped specialist who aims to strengthen my skills as a strong team player and an effective communicator. Read this as a Product Engineer capable of delivering end-to-end solutions.

## Skills
- Web Development (JavaScript/TypeScript/Python)
- Rest/GraphQL and Web API Architecture
- Agile, Test Driven Development (TDD), Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), Domain Driven Design (DDD).
- Very Interested in Accessability/a11y and wants to find a more formal way to support that.
- I'm good at changing my mind based on the available data, and that does not seem to be a skill everybody seems to have.
