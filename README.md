My interests revolve around `frontend`, `open-source`, and `devtools`.

- My current interest is contributing to the [@mdn](https://github.com/mdn) and learning new things along the way.  
- I am exploring design-systems.  
- I am also considering diving into learning a new programming language.

[My latest post on my blog](https://dbarabashh.github.io/blog/posts/2025-03-25-sharpen-your-skills-with-open-source/)

I support the community through open-source contributions, public speaking, organizing conferences, meetups, and workshops, as well as writing articles and tutorials.
